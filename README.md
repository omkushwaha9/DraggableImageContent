# DraggableImageContent

DraggableImageContent is an innovative webpage project featuring a unique gallery view that enhances user interaction through advanced functionalities. At the core of this project is a draggable and scalable box that dynamically responds to user input. When a pointer hovers over the box, it scales up to 1.1 times its original size, offering a more detailed preview. Upon clicking, the box scales down to 0.7 times its original size, allowing for better handling and manipulation. This box can be smoothly dragged across the screen, and when the pointer is released, the box slides in the direction of the last movement, coming to a halt only when it interacts with the screen's borders. Each box houses an image, complete with a pexels icon, a download option, file size details, and a download icon, all meticulously styled to achieve a visually appealing and functional design. The entire styling is accomplished using the React library Tailwind CSS, while the interactive animations are powered by Framer Motion, a renowned React animation library. This combination of technologies ensures a seamless, responsive, and visually captivating user experience.
